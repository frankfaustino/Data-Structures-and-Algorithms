## Data Structures

> In computer science, a __data structure__ is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a __data structure__ is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. _— [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)_

## Algorithms

> In mathematics and computer science, an __algorithm__ is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. "A set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations." — _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)_

## Why?

<p>As an auto-didact, I created this repository to expand my knowledge of computer science concepts. It's also motivated by my insatiable curiosity and deeply-seated fear of choking in a technical interview. 😬</p>
